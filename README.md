ROCO504 Group 5 Readme File

Robotic Jamming gripper Hand Repository

This is a repository created for the Roco 504 module at Plymouth University in the school of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics. The code, design files and additional folders are created specifically for this project. The code is developed to be used on an Arduino Mega 2560 using 4 potentionmeters to control the digit position. 

The code is a simple digit control as the majority of this project was research based looking at the limits of using the jamming transition for grip strength

The FEA is adapted from the early design work and guided the itterations of rapid prototyping

Tensile Testing Data was gathered in the Smeaton Materials Lab.
