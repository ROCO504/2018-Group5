This is the basic overview file of the different iterations of code.

Constant Speed - Test File to move the servos using the arduino at a constant speed
               -- Used to test the driver circuit was correct
               
Constant Speed Testing - See above

PotentControl - Controlling a singular digit using the connected potentiometer

PotentiometerFollowAll4WorkingEdit - Edit of the PotentControl File, repetition of code with different control pins
                                   -- Used to control all 4 digits
                                   -- Was intended for vacuum syringe, but torque was too low.
